// PSEUDO CODE:
// playlists have been saved to firebase
// want to press a button that will display the playlist(s)
// user must choose a playlist
    // will need some sort of menu that displays the users playlists
    // Discuss with group - a menu that slides out / a dropdown / ?
// once clicked, the playlist (podcasts) displays on screen
    // ensure that if any search results are currently being displayed, they are "replaced" by the users chosen playlist

import firebase from "../firebase";
